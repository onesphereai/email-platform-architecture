## Data Flow Patterns

### User Request Flow
```
B2B Customers → Internet → CloudFront → Angular App
                                    ↓
                              API Gateway → Authentication
                                    ↓
                            UI Service/Email API
```

### Email Processing Flow
```
Campaign Manager → Email Queue → Email Processor → Amazon SES
                                        ↓
                              DynamoDB + OpenSearch
```

### External Integration Flow
```
Message Centre → Email API → Campaign Manager → Processing Pipeline
```

### Monitoring Flow
```
All Services → CloudWatch → Monitoring Dashboard
```
